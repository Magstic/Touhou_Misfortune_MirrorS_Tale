I recognize this barrier.
Hmph, I wondered who it was, but it's you again.
What business do you have in the village?
So it was your doing that the scenery around here is strange.
Change the village back to normal right now.
I cannot do that.
The unsettling presence has not yet disappeared.
Sorry, but I'll have you leave here at once.
I have no business here, but I can't find my way like this.
I feel bad for you, but I'll have to force the village back to normal.
Now, I really need to move on this time.
I've been taking nothing but detours, and it's throwing me off.
