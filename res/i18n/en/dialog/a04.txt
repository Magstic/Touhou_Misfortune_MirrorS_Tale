There should be a human village around here...
I'm sure something like this has happened before.
So a yokai really did come here.
What business do you have in the village!
I remember there was one like you.
I have no business in a place like this.
More importantly, has Marisa been here?
The magician who was with me when I came before.
I don't know anyone like that.
Sorry, but I'm going to have you leave right now.
If you don't know, then I have no business with you.
You think a mere half-beast can drive me away?
This is bad... Marisa's form is getting blurry again...
What in the world happened to you?
