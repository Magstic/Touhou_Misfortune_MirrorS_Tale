...What'd you get for a souvenir from the underworld? A yakitori skewer and some binchotan charcoal~♪
Sigh, just when I'm in a hurry, I get held up...
Ooh, it pays to sing. A human has come.
...Though you seem a little different from a normal human.
Could you let me pass through here?
No can do. This is a dead end for humans.
Looks like I'll have to force my way through...
Well, I suppose yokai extermination is part of a shrine maiden's job...
It's been a while since I had a playmate. I won't let you escape!
So even night yokai are free during the day...
