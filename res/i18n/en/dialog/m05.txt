Whoa, fancy meeting you here.
What's up? Did the selfish lady finally give you some time off?
Of course not.
More importantly, I have business with you.
I'll have you come to the mansion for a bit.
Whoa, I'm busy right now.
Sorry, but you'll have to make it later.
The fact that you're in a hurry...
...it seems things are just as Lady Patchouli said.

Hmph, an errand for her, huh?
Sorry, but even if you tell me to come, I can't go right away.
I never expected you to come along quietly in the first place.
It seems I'll have to make you behave by force.
Geez...
I was hoping to deal with this before the others found out.
In any case, it looks like I'd better hurry.
