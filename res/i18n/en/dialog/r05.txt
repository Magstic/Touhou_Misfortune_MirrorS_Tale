Oh? You came too?
For even you to show up, it seems our purpose is the same.
I have no idea what you're talking about, but
could you let me pass?
That thing was originally a problem from our mansion.
The shrine maiden can stay at the shrine and drink tea, you know.
I'd love to do just that, but
unfortunately, I'm not in the mood for that today.
Sorry, but I'll have to force my way through.
Oh, is that so? But cleaning is a maid's job.
Sorry, but I'll have to stop your time until it's done.
Hmm, something flashed over there.
Ah, wait!
