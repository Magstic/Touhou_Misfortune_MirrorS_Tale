Oh my, how strange to see you in a place like this.
Were you sent on an errand, I wonder?
That is none of your concern.
I'm in a hurry, would you mind not getting in my way?
Hah, I have no intention of interfering, but for you yourself...
...to be out running errands like this...
Your subordinates must be truly useless.
Some may be lazy, but that is not true of all of them.
More importantly, shouldn't you be heading back soon?
Oh? I'm in a hurry myself, you know.
I can't just turn back in a place like this.
Then why don't you go on ahead?
Yes, I think I'll deal with the human in front of me first...
...and then proceed.
Well then, now that I've dealt with the human in front of me...
...I think I'll be on my way.
