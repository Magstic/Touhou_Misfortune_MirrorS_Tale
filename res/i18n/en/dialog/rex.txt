Oh? What are you doing in a place like this?
Heehee...
Alice?|No, doesn't seem like it.
Get me out of this strange place, and fast.
No can do.
I'm going to have you disappear...
...so that I can become you.
Hmph, not just anyone can be a shrine maiden.
I can become anyone.
Whether it's a shrine maiden or a magician.
You're just borrowing their form.
That's just a fake.
Hmph, the sadness of not having your own form...
...is something you wouldn't understand anyway.
But from now on, you'll become just that.
The danmaku of a mirror that loses sight of all, taste it with your own body!
No, my power is no match for this...
To be no match even in a yokai's form... who in the world are you...?
I'm just a human who specializes in yokai extermination.
Now, all that's left is to return you to the Scarlet Devil Mansion.
Ah, the days of not being able to reflect anyone will begin again.
Hmm? You can't reflect anyone's form?
I was thrown into storage because I couldn't reflect the form of the master of that mansion.
In a way, it might have been a good thing that Marisa took me out.
When I return you to Sakuya, I'll ask her to display you somewhere.
But if you pull anything next time, I'll smash you to pieces.
