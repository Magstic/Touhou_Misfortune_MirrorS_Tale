Oh, you're here again.
It's been a while since I've been here.
Not that I particularly wanted to come...
Welcome to the Mayohiga.
To come again, you're a strange one.
Ah, since I'm here, I might as well borrow a few things.
The village does not grant fortune to the greedy.
So you're saying it'll grant me fortune?
I never said anything about stealing.
I'm the one who gets in trouble if you just take things without permission.
I'll have you leave at once!
Oh, I see the exit.|I'll come back to borrow things next time.
