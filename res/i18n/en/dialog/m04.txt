I thought there was a village around here...
Maybe I'm lost...
You're that magician from before.
So you were the source of the unsettling presence I felt around the village.
Hmm, seems I'm under some strange misunderstanding.
And what if I was?
I'll drive you out of the village.
Being told to leave just makes me want to stay here forever.
Hmph, if that's your attitude,
then I'll just have to defend this village with all my might!
That unsettling presence you mentioned earlier...
In a way, it might really be my doing.
