Finally caught you.
Oh my, so the real one finally shows up.
Yeah, I've gotta get rid of the fake around here.
'Cause it's causing me all sorts of trouble.
Oh? You say I'm the fake?
What proof do you have?
It'd be weird if there were two of me, right?
So it'd be fine if you just disappeared, wouldn't it?
Hey, hey, if I disappeared, all the humans and yokai in Gensokyo would be sad.
But there's no problem if you disappear.
So, that's why I'm gonna beat you here, go home, and break that mirror.
As if I'd let you do that!
Hmph, if the real one's gone, even a fake can become the real thing!
I'll take your existence for myself!
The danmaku of another you...|Can you see through it?
