Hey, no entry beyond this point.
Agh, Lady Ran and Lady Yukari don't want to go out in the cold, so why me...
I'm cold too, and I want to go home!
Then why did you come?!
I have my own circumstances.
Besides, it was just by chance that I came here!
You were already lost the moment you came here.
And to be able to come here again, you're quite lucky.
To be lucky for getting lost... that's a strange thing to say...
Where's the exit?
Whoa, if I let you escape so easily, the name of the Mayohiga will be shamed!
Honestly, cats should just stay home and sleep...
