So if you couldn't beat me as Marisa,
you've decided to take my form instead?
Heehee, what a coincidence.
This only happened because you carelessly peered into me.
...Is that so.
For now, if I defeat you, will I be able to get out of here?
You seem to be thinking quite optimistically,
but do you really think you can defeat me?
I told you when I was in Marisa's form, didn't I?
A fake is no match for the original, after all.
I wonder about that.
I'll show you all the power I've reflected.
An infinite danmaku that reflects all... Can you see through it?
No, how could this be...
I've told you time and time again.
Borrowed power is ultimately inferior to the original.
By the way, why were you borrowing Marisa's form?
I thought I was left in a dark place for hundreds of years,
but before I knew it, I was in that magician's house.
And since she so carelessly exposed her form to me,
I helped myself to borrowing it.
Ah, it must be because you were dwelling with such strange magic...
...that she took an interest and brought you home.
I need to return such a troublesome item to its owner quickly.
Now, it's about time you returned to where you belong.
Ugh... I'll go back on my own when I wake up.
