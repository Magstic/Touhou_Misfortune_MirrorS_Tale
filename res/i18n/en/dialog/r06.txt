I finally found you.
Geh, Reimu.
Fancy meeting you here.
Wait, there are two Marisas.
What's going on here?
Well... you see. A lot has happened...
Anyway, my fake was over there causing trouble for me.
Hmm, two Marisas would be quite a nuisance.
That's not what I meant...
Fine, after I take care of the fake Marisa,
I'll have you tell me everything.
By the way, that one over there is the fake, right?
Hey, hey, I'm the real one.
That means the fake is over there.
Heehee, how rude to call me a fake.
And if I were, would that be a problem?
If there are two Marisas, it's a problem for me!
This form I've finally obtained...
I'll have the real one over there disappear.|I won't let you interfere.
