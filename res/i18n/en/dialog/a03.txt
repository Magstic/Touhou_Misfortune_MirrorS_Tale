It's rare for a yokai to visit a place like this.
What a strange place. I wonder when I got so lost.
Welcome. This is the Mayohiga.
A hidden village that only the lost can find their way to.
I see. So I really was lost after all.
I'm in a hurry. Which way is the exit?
You think you can get back that easily?
Well, yes. There's a cat right in front of me who looks like she knows the way out.
I'll just make her my guide.
Like I'd ever guide the likes of you!
Perhaps I overdid it a little.
Oh, well. I'm sure I'll get out of here eventually.
