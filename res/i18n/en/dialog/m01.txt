Why don't you just come out already?
You think you're well hidden, but it's totally obvious. (Lying)
Hey Sunny, he's found us!!
What? Isn't it because you were slacking off, Luna?
...
Hasn't your power been getting weaker lately, Sunny?
Of course not!
Looks like one of 'em got away?
Aah!!
We were too slow to escape because you were being so loud, Sunny!!
Sorry to interrupt while you're busy, but I'm gonna go on ahead.
Alright, this time I'm really going on ahead.
