Hold it right there!
What's a human doing all alone in a place like this?
Seems like it's just one interruption after another today.
And for the record, I'm not human.
Nice try, but a lie like that won't get you anywhere.
You now have an obligation to listen to my song until you go blind in the dark.
I'm not aware of any such obligation.
Listen here. If you're going to get in my way, I'll crush you for real.
Still putting on a tough act, I see. Fine. I'll give you a listen right now.
...Hmph. I don't have time to waste on your racket.
