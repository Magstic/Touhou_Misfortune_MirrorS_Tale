I've finally caught you.
If I can just do something about you,
this whole inexplicable incident around Marisa should be resolved.
Oh? So you were the one chasing me.
I thought for sure it was the original.
But even if you want to 'do something' about me, that's impossible.
I'll manage it somehow.
It's always been the case that fakes are never a big deal.
What terrible prejudice.
My power is almost identical to the real thing.
And with my own power added on top, I'm even better than the original.
Oh? Now that's interesting.
Well then, shall I put that to the test?
Fine by me.
A false danmaku that surpasses the original...|I wonder if you can dodge it all?
