Just when I thought I'd visit the human village for a change, I get interrupted.
A night sparrow when it's not even night? How rare.
You've got some bad luck, don't you?
When you meet a night sparrow all alone, it's all over for you.
I think that only applies to dark roads at night.
Besides, I'm an expert at yokai extermination.
Hmph, any yokai that could be exterminated by you can't be much of a threat.
Actually, exterminating night sparrows is my specialty.
Eh?
That's a lie.
I won't forgive you!
Exterminating a yokai now and then isn't so bad.
