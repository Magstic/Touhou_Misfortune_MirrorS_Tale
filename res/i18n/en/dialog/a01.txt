What's all that scurrying I've been hearing?
I know you're there. Come on out!
Oh, I thought that voice sounded familiar. It's you, Alice...
Hey! How did none of us notice her?
Well, you'd never expect to run into her in a place like this!
･･･
Oh? If it isn't the three "yokai" of light from the other day...
I believe I told you I wouldn't go easy on you next time, didn't I?
Ahaha... (Crap, Star is making a run for it.)
Ahaha... (Wait, Sunny too?!)
You're not getting away!
Next time, I really won't hold back, you hear?
