Oh, Alice.
What are you doing in a place like this?
Heehee...
Something's off about you.
Did you eat a weird mushroom or something?
I haven't eaten anything like that.
I wonder if you don't know who I am?
Hmm, who the heck are you?
I am the very world you are looking at right now.
The one who was borrowing your form until just now.
Of all people, now you're Alice.
I can become anyone.
Whether they're human or yokai.
Oh, that sounds interesting.
But the real Alice isn't as twisted as you, you know?
Heehee, that's not a big problem.
If I erase the original, then I become the real thing.
Can you attack the form of your own friend?
What the mirror reflects is an illusion, a danmaku without substance. Can you dodge it?
No, I can't even win in this form...
Who in the world are you...?
I'm just an ordinary magician you can find anywhere.
By the way, are you that mirror?
That's right.
Thanks to you bringing me out of that mansion,
I thought I could finally get a physical body.
Well, vampires don't reflect in mirrors, after all.
Oh yeah, how do I get out of here?
This is the world of dreams. When you wake up, you'll get out on your own.
The world of dreams, huh? Sounds like a dream itself.
