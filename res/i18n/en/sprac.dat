A barrage that evokes the image of sunlight pouring down.
Slightly increased density and amount of falling light. It’s not that difficult.
A halation under a clear sky. Dazzling.
If you start seeing multiple suns, you might be tired.
Apparently, some people are truly bad at patterns where bullets come from different directions.
There is an opinion that a single powerful radiant sun is easier than twins.
If you could actually see this, it would probably look very fantastical.
It might even look like fireflies.
Does moonlight drive people mad?
Luna’s moon gives a gentle, mysterious light, but since it is “fake,” it does not drive one mad.
A rain of stardust — in reality, only light, no actual stars are flying.
A slightly stronger stardust rain — is it just that the light has intensified?
In bullet hell, stronger light means higher density, perhaps.
This is Star’s full power; it seems she cannot go further than this.
A barrage created cooperatively by three of them.
Yet, in such cooperative patterns, Sunny is actually the one who struggles the most.
In truth, even together, their combined power is less than a single youkai — after all, they are fairies.
Sometimes there are fairies with great power; what would happen if there were four?
Be careful in the dark forest — even the rustling of leaves sounds like whispers.
Ghost stories always accompany forests. Are they really just rumors?
There are many dangers in the forest beyond youkai.
In some large regional forests, youkai rumors still persist.
A birdcage with wide gaps — but what it wants to trap is humans.
If you reach the cage, is escape impossible? Yet only some bullets are truly aimed.
If you saw an open cage, you might walk in — but that would be dangerous.
The “cage” here is actually the forest itself — the forest is a giant cage.
If you go to a food stall and they offer “blind service,” you don’t need that.
They say if you meet a night sparrow in daylight, you’ll get night blindness — but then you could just go home normally, right?
She is not a siren, but what she does is similar?
Yet I’ve never heard of a siren selling lampreys at a stall.
Though “senri” can be mistaken for a tanuki, here it actually means mountain cat.
She appears immediately when an intruder arrives — perhaps she was bored.
The strange bullets on the left and right actually represent Chen’s tails. Hard to see?
The central bullets represent “a cat curling up under a kotatsu.” Hmm… still hard to see.
If she gets serious, she can even dance through the sky. No one can catch a cat running at full speed.
When moving back and forth, it almost looks like she’s dancing… doesn’t it?
In the end, this motion perfectly captures Chen’s image.
The name slightly alters that of a celestial maiden from Chinese mythology. “Meow meow.”
A back-and-forth barrage — in some ways, harder to read than reflection.
I added a bit of Chen’s original flavor, but it hasn’t changed much.
Taiyi Divination is essentially fortune-telling — seeing a small nation’s future through bullet patterns.
No one can predict Gensokyo’s future. What lies ahead?
Shunkashikō — an invisible barrage bursting from Chen’s eyes.
If you read it as “matatabi,” it sounds very cat-like.
Tamonten, also known as Bishamonten.
I’ve never seen a cat spin this much.
About the beginning of the world.
In truth, the surrounding bullets are shaped like torii gates.
After the creation of heaven and earth, when they began to move separately.
If the bullets reach the torii, avoidance becomes impossible.
The moment when Kagutsuchi, the fire god, is born — and simultaneously, Izanami dies.
An unfortunate god, killed at birth — he did nothing wrong.
The Ten-Fist Sword that killed Kagutsuchi: flaming blade-bullets attack the player.
The surroundings are already a sea of fire.
Izanagi chases his dead wife to Yomi, the underworld.
Who is more unfortunate — Izanagi, who saw his rotting wife, or Izanami, who was seen?
To escape, Izanagi sealed the entrance with a great boulder.
In this barrage, you actually dodge inside that boulder.
His purification in Tsukushi.
Though it depicts cleansing defilement, the barrage is beautiful — because gods are born from it.
Three deities are born when the filth of Yomi is washed away.
Izanagi’s story ends here — hence, “Final Sign.”
Sakuya is in a rather bad mood. She shows terrifying dreams like a threat.
A sudden rain of knives — if they don’t hit, you might think it’s a dream.
So many knives you might go insane — but it’s still just a threat.
If something terrifying happens suddenly, you freeze — you wish it were just a dream.
Teleportation and sudden knife appearances — not difficult if you stay calm.
Knives placed during teleportation — seems troublesome.
A double-layered transforming barrage space.
Just leaving red bullets behind drastically changes the difficulty — frightening.
Sakuya handles knives effortlessly.
A collection of knife techniques, including time-stop tricks.
Originating from knives associated with vampires.
Terrifying speed and overwhelming quantity.
A bullet clock spinning in reverse — notice there is no second hand.
This time, the second hand exists.
Rewinding too far causes time travel — a barrage of attacking time.
An untouchable timeline where illusion and reality coexist.
A shooting star that fires bullets.
Higher frequency of bullet-shooting stars.
More appearing at once.
I like the name, but the pattern itself is mediocre.
A starry barrage — if you’re distracted, you lose lives.
An unsettling barrage — if you stop, you’re finished.
At this density, there’s nothing you can do.
Actually, this was stolen and rearranged from another magician’s barrage.
A wave of bullets from all directions — the worst part is that you can’t destroy the source.
Despite being called “Mirror,” the pattern isn’t symmetrical. I hate it.
The Great Labyrinth is based on a mirror house.
Two mirrors create infinite reflections — what if there were more?
First: Satellite — a relatively simple collection of patterns.
Increased density; not too bad once you get used to it.
Planet — same pattern, but harsher?
Cosmos — actually one of my favorite spells.
What if something that should only exist once appears multiple times?
Almost like a curse — it weakens the target’s existence, but with fluctuations.
Behind-the-scenes story: I wondered how to make Marisa a final boss — so I created a fake.
Continued: The “fake” is the origin of the “mirror” in the title.
Alice chased the White Rabbit into a strange world.
Her tears filled the room like an ocean.
The monster Jabberwock represented in bullet form — the bride is something else.
A heart nearly broken by painful events. [Heart]
Beyond the mirror, a death god was seen. [Joker]
Does a four-leaf clover truly bring happiness? [Clover]
The sword that slew the monster also beheaded its wielder. [Spade]
Actually the first endurance spell. [Diamond]
The dream shown by the mirror ends here — so who is the mirror?
She went all out — dazzling, but not that hot.
A barrage that grants eternal sleep — was the wish fulfilled?
Actually, she was just a decoy; Sunny and Luna prepared the real barrage behind the scenes.
“Sometimes, I think boiling them isn’t so bad.” — by Mystia
The last remaining of the four lost Shikisen used by youkai — still active in Gensokyo.
The history of Touhou fanworks is so vast that even Keine can’t grasp it anymore… probably.
Her final trump card — she rarely ever shows this.
A spell that artificially generates a small galaxy with immense magical power.
A world of nightmares — in fact, Alice will never fall unless you reach the very end.
