Alice "Marisa, what was that Marisa|just now?"
Marisa "It feels weird being called|Marisa Marisa."
Marisa "That came out when I was |investigating the mirror I|found at the Scarlet Devil Mansion."
Marisa "I won't know the principle |behind it unless I investigate."
Alice "If the cause is something |found at that mansion,there's|someone who would know about it."
Alice "Actually, it seemed like the|maid was looking for it?"
Alice "I wonder if she already knows|about this incident."
The cause of the series of disturbances|was in the mirrorMarisa took out.
Originally, the same person cannot exist|at the same time.
Those whose form is stolen by that|mirror become vague in existence,
and if left alone, they will be swapped|with themselves inside the mirror.
Alice "Actually, Marisa's memory was|a bit strange until just a while ago."
Alice "She seems calm now, but wasn't|it actually a very dangerous situation?"
Marisa "Was that so? If we|investigate that mirror,|we might understand something."
Thus the two decided to investigate|the mirror,not yet knowing that it|would cause another disturbance.
