This is Marisa's house in the Forest|of Magic.
The other Marisa has vanished, and|the curse that was on Marisa|was fading away.
Marisa "Managed to resolve it before|*she* found out."
Reimu "Who is *she*?"
Alice "Oh, Marisa. You're back."
The trigger for the disturbance was|the mirror Marisa took from the|Scarlet Devil Mansion.
A mirror that accumulates years without|having its own form eventually|wishes to have its own form.
Items imbued with magic strongly|stimulate a magician's curiosity.
Therefore, peering into the mirror|harboring mysterious power was|the beginning.
Alice "So, what was that other|Marisa?"
Marisa "It came out when I looked|into the mirror
from the Scarlet Devil Mansion."
Reimu "You took it without asking,|didn't you. You should consult the owner|about what kind of mirror it is."
Alice "So, where is that mirror?"
Marisa "That mirror is right there."
Reimu "Hey, what are you two doing!"
The mirror disturbance continues|a little longer.
