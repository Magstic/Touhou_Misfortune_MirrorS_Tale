This is the Hakurei Shrine,|located at the boundary of Gensokyo.
Marisa "So, why is everyone|gathered here?"
Alice "Because you caused a scene,|obviously."
Reimu "And, what was that|thing earlier?"
Marisa "Ah, that. It's a long story,|so maybe later... no good?"
Reimu "No good. I'll make some tea,|so explain everything,|no matter how long it takes."
Gensokyo, where forgotten things end up.|Tools that become old and unused may|eventually gain a will of their own.
The cause of this disturbance was|Marisa taking a mirror with mysterious|powers that should have been kept
in the Scarlet Devil Mansion,|and peering into it without permission.
A mirror that only reflects others|but never possesses its own form.
The will residing in the mirror might|have tried to grant the wish hidden|within the mirror.
Marisa "I wouldn't say took without|permission, I borrowed it."
Sakuya "So, where is that mirror?"
Marisa "If it's that,|I think it's still at my place."
Thus the mirror was returned to the|Scarlet Mansion, and the disturbance|seemed to have settled down...?
